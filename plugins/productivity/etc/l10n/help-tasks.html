<p>The Tasks tab displays a hierarchy of tasks and sub-tasks associated with the 
current selected projects. This hierarchy also includes association of 
discussion items and files to those tasks. Each task displayed includes a 
checkbox that can be used to complete/uncomplete that task if the user has 
permission to do so. Optionally, for tasks that are dependent on completion of 
a form, when the user attempts to complete that task, the corresponding for will 
appear for them to complete.</p>

<p>The right side of the Tasks tab displays a 1-month due-date calendar and a 
form that can be used to further filter and determine how tasks are displayed.</p>
