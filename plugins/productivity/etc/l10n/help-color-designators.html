MyProjects uses 3 color designators to identify late, upcoming and future 
projects and tasks. 
<ul>
<li>Late items are those whose due dates are past the current date and 
identified using red highlighting or text</li>
<li>Upcoming items are those whose due dates reside between the current date and 
the user's upcoming date threshold (the default upcoming threshold is 14 days, 
this value is configured using the MyProjects - Preferences menu item) and 
identified using yellow highlighting or text</li>
<li>Future items are those whose due dates reside after the user's upcoming date 
threshold and identified using green highlighting or text</li>
</ul>
