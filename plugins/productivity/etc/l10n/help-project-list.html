The upper right corner of the MyProjects window provides a link containing the 
number of projects that are currently selected for display. Clicking on this 
link will display a drop-down listing those specific projects along with 
checkboxes for selecting and deselecting those corresponding projects. Whenever 
a change to the project selection is made, the MyProjects window will be 
reloaded to display only the discussion, tasks, and files for those selected 
projects.
