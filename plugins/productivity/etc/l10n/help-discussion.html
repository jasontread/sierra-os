<p>The Discussion tab allows users to add messages, comments and whiteboards to 
projects including association of those items to projects and tasks. Messages 
can also be configured to include email interactions whereby responses to 
messages via email will also be recorded in the discussion tab as comments 
associated with the original message. Additionally, files can be attached to 
messages and comments both via the MyProjects message and comment forms and via 
email.</p>

<p>Whiteboards provide a real-time collaborative space for users to add drawing 
based discussion to a project and task. Use of whiteboards requires a java 
enabled web browser.</p>

<p>The right side of the Discussion tab window can be used to further filter 
and determine how discussion items are displayed.</p>
