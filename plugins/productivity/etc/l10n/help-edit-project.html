To edit a project, click on the project title anywhere within the MyProjects 
window. If you have edit privileges to that project, an 'Edit' link will appear 
in the upper right corner of the project popup window. Click on that link, and 
a new tabbed window will appear with the corresponding fields for editing that 
project.
