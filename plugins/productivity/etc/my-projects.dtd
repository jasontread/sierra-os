<!--
XML DTD for the SIERRA::OS "productivity" plugin MyProjects application, v1.0

This DTD allows users of the productivity plugin to define project templates 
available from within the MyProjects application it provides. Each xml file 
must be declared in app-config using the "param" element where the type is 
"my-projects" and the id is the app "/etc" relative path to the xml file (or 
absolute path)

To support validation of your plugin xml file, include the following DOCTYPE 
element at the beginning (after the "xml" declaration):

<!DOCTYPE my-projects PUBLIC "-//SIERRA//DTD SRAOS Productivity::MyProjects//EN" 
  "http://sierra-os.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/etc/plugins/productivity/etc/my-projects.dtd">
-->


<!--
The "my-projects" element is the root element. it defines 1 or more project 
templates
                  
resources         the app relative or fixed path to the resource bundle to use 
                  for project templates defined in the xml document. if not 
                  specified, the app resources will be used


Used in:	NA

<!ELEMENT my-projects (template+)>
<!ATTLIST my-projects resources      CDATA       #IMPLIED>


<!--
The "template" element is used to define a single project template
                  
key               the identifier for this project template. this value will be 
                  stored in the "type" attribute for projects created based on 
                  this template. it MUST be unique globally
                  
complete-confirm  the resource identifier for an optional completion confirm 
                  message. the user will be required to read this message and 
                  click 'OK' before projects based on this template can be 
                  completed
                  
due-date          a relative date expression defining the the default due-date 
                  for projects based on this template. for more information, see 
                  the SRA_GregorianDate::fromRelativeStr() api. if a "wf" is 
                  defined for the template, and that workflow has a due date, 
                  that due date will take precedence over the template due date
                  
due-date-fixed    whether or not the template due-date specified should be fixed. 
                  if true, the user will not be able to change that value. 
                  workflow due dates are always fixed
                  
help-topic        if a help menu entry should be added to MyProjects for this 
                  project template, this attribute should reference the id of 
                  that help topic in "plugin-for-help-topic"

help-topic-resource if "help-topic" is specified, this attribute may be used to 
                  also specify a resource to use for the help topic label. if 
                  not specified, a default label "[project template name] Help" 
                  will be used
                  
icon              the uri to the icon to use to represent this project template. 
                  this icon must be available in 16, 32, and 64 pixel sizes. 
                  this value MUST contain the substring "${size}" which will be 
                  replaced with the correct icon size. if not specified, the 
                  default MyProjects icon will be used

include-new-menu  whether or not this project template should be included in the 
                  MyProjects "File -> New" menu
                  
name              the resource identifier for the default name to assign 
                  projects based on this template. this resource value may 
                  reference params from "wf-tpl" using the format "{$param}"
                  
notify            whether or not to notify users whenever they are assigned to 
                  a task. this includes both the creator of the task (when 
                  'strict-permissions' is not true) as well as the user(s) 
                  specific through the 'change-restriction'. these users will 
                  only be notified once when the task is created, or whenever 
                  re-assignment of the change-restriction occurs. the email 
                  settings that will be used for the from address are the same 
                  documented in the MyProjectsManager::retrievePopMessages api.
                  all tasks within this template will automatically inherit this 
                  template configuration unless they specify another value
                  
notify-subject    if 'notify' is true, this attribute can be used to define a 
                  custom notification subject resource identifier in 
                  'resources'. if not specified, the default 
                  'MyProjectTask.notify.subject' (in the productivity resources 
                  files) will be used. all tasks within this template will 
                  automatically inherit this template configuration unless they 
                  specify another value
                  
notify-tpl        if 'notify' is true, this attribute can be used to define a 
                  custom notification template. this template will have access 
                  to the follow smarty variables:
                    email:        the email address
                    name:         the name of the person the email is being sent 
                                  to
                    project:      a reference to the task project
                    projectAdmin: a reference to the project administrator user 
                                  object
                    resources:    a reference to the template resource bundle
                    task:         a reference to the MyProjectTask object
                    uid:          if the email is for an actual user of the 
                                  system, this value will be the uid of the 
                                  user. otherwise (for an email participant), 
                                  this value will be NULL
                  if not specified, the default 
                  'productivity/tpl/my-projects-task-notification.tpl' template 
                  will be used. all tasks within this template will 
                  automatically inherit this template configuration unless they 
                  specify another value
                  
notify-tpl-html   if 'notify' is true, this attribute can be used to define a 
                  custom html notification template. this template will have 
                  access to the same smarty variable as 'notify-tpl'. if not 
                  specified, the default 
                  'productivity/tpl/my-projects-task-notification-html.tpl' 
                  template will be used. if both 'notify-tpl' and 
                  'notify-tpl-html' are specified, most users will only see the 
                  html version of the notification unless they do not have a 
                  multipart/html email client. all tasks within this template 
                  will automatically inherit this template configuration unless 
                  they specify another value
                  
plugin-for-help-topic the id of the plugin containing "help-topic" and 
                  whose resources should be used for "help-topic-resource"
                  
plugin-for-labels the id of the plugin whose resources should be used for the 
                  project labels. these labels are displayed on the new project 
                  wizard and edit project popup window and include the following 
                  (default values below will be used if resource key is not 
                  defined):

summary           the resource identifier for the default summary to assign 
                  projects based on this template. this resource value may 
                  reference params from "wf-tpl" using the format "{$param}"
                  
type              the resource identifier for this template. this value will 
                  be used to allow users to filter search results based on 
                  project type, as an option in the new projects menu, and 
                  within the project summary
                  
wf                if this project template should be based on an application 
                  workflow, this value should be the identifier for that 
                  workflow as specified in app-config (the "use-workflow" 
                  element). when a project is based on a workflow, tasks will 
                  automatically be created based on the workflow definition and 
                  progress

wf-ajax-validator if "wf-tpl" is used, this attribute may be used to specify a 
                  global ajax service that should be used to validate the data 
                  that was provided by the user and return the data that should 
                  be included as the workflow initiation parameters. this method 
                  should return either an error message (this message will be 
                  displayed to the user and they will not be allowed to 
                  continue), or TRUE if the validation was successful and the 
                  workflow should be initialized with the same values from the 
                  form, or an array representing the values that should be used 
                  to initialize the workflow

wf-notify-step    whether or not to send standard MyProjects task notifications 
                  for workflow step generated tasks
                  
wf-notify-task    whether or not to send standard MyProjects task notifications 
                  for workflow task generated tasks
                  
wf-tpl            a form template that should be displayed in the first step of 
                  the project creation prompting the user to enter data that 
                  will be used by the workflow. this data will be extracted from 
                  the form and used as the initiation params for the workflow
                  
wf-tpl-init       an initialization function for wf-tpl. this function should be 
                  global with the following signature: "(divId : String) : void"
                  where divId is the base window div id enclosing wf-tpl (any 
                  nested elements in this page will have their id prefixed with 
                  this value)

wf-validator      if "wf-tpl" is used, this attribute may be used to specify a
                  javascript function that should be invoked to validate the 
                  data. this method should return true if the data validates 
                  successfully, an error message otherwise. if both 
                  "wf-validator" and "wf-ajax-validator" are specified, this 
                  validator will be invoked first. this function should have the 
                  following signature: "(params : hash) : mixed"
                  
wf-view-tpl       template that should be used to display the wf initialization 
                  parameters from wf-tpl in a read-only format. when this 
                  template is rendered, the values for each of the wf-tpl values 
                  will be set as template variables. once a project is created, 
                  the wf-tpl form values cannot be changed. this attribute is 
                  required if wf-tpl is specified
