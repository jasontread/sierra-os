The Help Manual is a simple application for viewing of contextual help articles. 
Most applications have a help menu or imbedded help links. Clicking on these 
will launch the help manual.

The Help Manual window contains 2 panels. The first panel located on the left 
side displays the topic navigation links. These will be relevant to 
the application or window that launched the Help Manual. Clicking on the + and - 
icons will expand and collapse topics that contain sub-topics and clicking on 
the topic icons themselves will display the article that has been written about 
that topic on the right-side panel.

If you desire to print an article, simply click on the print icon in the toolbar 
or the print item in the <i>File</i> menu. This will launch a new window 
containing a print formatted version of that article.
