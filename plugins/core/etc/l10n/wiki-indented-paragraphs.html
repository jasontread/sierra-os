<p class='vspace'>Inverted Arrows (<code class='escaped'>-&lt;</code>) at the beginning of a paragraph can be used to produce a paragraph with a hanging indent.  Adding hyphens at the beginning (<code class='escaped'>---&lt;</code>) causes all the text to indent.

<p class='vspace'>Blocks of text to which <code class='escaped'>(:linebreaks:)</code> has been applied can be indented by preceding the first line of the block with indention arrows (<code class='escaped'>-&gt;</code>) and aligning subsequent lines under the first. An unindented line stops the block indentation.
